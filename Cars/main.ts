//QUESTION NO: 45
//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
//The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
//should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
//with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
//color or an optional feature. 
//Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
//stored correctly.


function carinfo(manufacturer:string , modelName: string, othersoption: { colour: string, [key: string]: any} ) :
object  {
    const carinfo = {
        manufacturer, 
        modelName,
        ...othersoption
    }
    return carinfo;
};

const car = carinfo ("Honda", "Civic", { colour: "white", features: ["Power window"]});
console.log(car);
